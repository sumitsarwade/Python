    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of some programming languages, including Python, that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from multiple parent classes. In other words, a class can derive from more than one base class simultaneously. This allows the subclass to inherit and combine features from multiple parent classes, providing flexibility in code organization and reuse."

    "In multiple inheritance, a class can inherit attributes, methods, and behavior from each of its parent classes. It can access and use the attributes and methods of all its parent classes directly. However, multiple inheritance can lead to complexities, such as conflicts between inherited methods with the same name or ambiguity in resolving attribute references. Programming languages that support multiple inheritance usually provide rules or mechanisms to handle these complexities, such as method resolution order (MRO) or explicit method override."
