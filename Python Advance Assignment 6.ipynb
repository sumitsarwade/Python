    "Error Handling: Exception processing is widely used for error handling scenarios. When an error occurs during the execution of a program, such as file I/O errors, network errors, or invalid user input, exceptions can be raised to handle these exceptional conditions. By catching and handling exceptions, you can gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate feedback or take corrective actions.\n",

    "Resource Management: Exception processing is crucial for managing resources properly, such as files, database connections, network sockets, or system handles. Exceptions allow you to release or clean up resources even in the presence of errors or exceptional situations. For example, you can use the finally block to ensure that resources are properly closed or released, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not."

This behavior is known as an \"unhandled exception\" or \"exception propagation.\"\n",
