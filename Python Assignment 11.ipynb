   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Using logging messages is generally considered better than using print() statements for displaying messages in your code for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility and configurability: The logging module in Python provides a wide range of features and options for logging. You can control the log message format, specify log levels, define different log handlers (e.g., write logs to files, send logs to external services), and configure loggers for different parts of your code independently. This flexibility allows you to customize and fine-tune the logging behavior to suit your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging levels: The logging module offers different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) that allow you to control the verbosity and severity of the logged messages. By using appropriate logging levels, you can easily filter and manage the output based on the importance and relevance of the logged information. In contrast, print() statements don't provide this built-in concept of severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity and selective logging: With logging, you can choose to log specific parts of your code or modules selectively by configuring different loggers and handlers. This allows you to focus on particular areas of interest for troubleshooting and debugging purposes without cluttering the output with irrelevant information. In contrast, using print() statements may require manual addition/removal of print statements when you want to control the output in different parts of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Runtime enable/disable: The logging module allows you to easily enable or disable logging messages globally or for specific parts of your code by adjusting the log level or configuring log handlers. This is particularly useful in production environments where you may want to disable or reduce the amount of logging output without modifying the code itself. With print() statements, you would need to manually add or remove them, which can be error-prone and tedious.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with existing logging infrastructure: The logging module provides a standardized way of logging that integrates well with existing logging infrastructure and tools. It allows you to work with log aggregators, log analysis tools, and logging frameworks that provide advanced features such as log rotation, log filtering, and log storage. Using print() statements makes it harder to integrate with such infrastructure and may require additional manual work to achieve similar functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Code maintainability: Using logging messages promotes better code organization and maintainability. By separating the concerns of logging and application logic, you keep your code cleaner and more modular. It also allows for easier troubleshooting and debugging by providing a centralized and consistent way to handle and manage log messages."
