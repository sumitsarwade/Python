    "Function name: Choose a descriptive and meaningful name for your function that accurately conveys its purpose. The name should follow the naming conventions of the programming language and adhere to any specific naming guidelines of the project or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Function length: Keep your functions concise and focused on a single task. Functions should ideally be short and have a clear and specific responsibility. Long and overly complex functions can be difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Function arguments: Minimize the number of function arguments, as excessive parameters can make functions harder to use and understand. If a function has too many arguments, consider grouping related arguments into a data structure or using keyword arguments to enhance readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Single responsibility principle: Functions should adhere to the principle of having a single responsibility. Each function should perform one specific task or operation. If a function is doing too many things, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and reusability: Design functions to be modular and reusable. Functions should encapsulate a specific task or functionality that can be easily utilized in different parts of the codebase. Avoid duplicating code by promoting code reuse through functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: Include clear and meaningful docstrings for your functions. Docstrings provide a way to document the purpose, behavior, and usage of a function. Follow the conventions of your programming language or project for writing docstrings, and include information about parameters, return values, and any exceptions that may be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling: Consider how your function should handle errors and exceptional cases. Use appropriate error handling mechanisms like try-except blocks or specific error-raising patterns to handle exceptional situations gracefully. Provide informative error messages that help in debugging and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and formatting: Write functions that are easy to read and understand. Use consistent and clear indentation, follow a consistent naming style, and separate blocks of code with blank lines. Employ comments judiciously to explain complex logic or document important details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid global variables: Minimize the use of global variables within functions as they can lead to code coupling and make functions less modular and reusable. Pass required data as function arguments or use local variables within the function scope whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
