    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function or model that describes the likelihood of different outcomes or events occurring in a specific situation or system. It provides a way to represent and analyze the probabilities associated with different possible values or events. In simple terms, a probability distribution describes how likely various outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the values represented by a probability distribution may appear random, they are not meant to be unpredictable in the sense of being completely arbitrary. Instead, a probability distribution quantifies the likelihood or probability of different outcomes occurring based on certain assumptions or characteristics of the system or phenomenon under consideration. By using probability distributions, we can analyze and make predictions about the likelihood of specific events or the behavior of random variables."

True random numbers are generated from a source of genuine randomness, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. They are considered to be truly unpredictable and independent of any previous numbers generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are generated using deterministic algorithms that start from an initial seed value. While the sequence of pseudo-random numbers may exhibit statistical properties similar to random numbers, they are ultimately deterministic and repeatable given the same seed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they possess qualities similar to true random numbers. They have desirable statistical properties, such as uniformity and independence, and are useful in various simulations, numerical computations, and algorithms. For most practical purposes, pseudo-random numbers provide sufficient randomness and can effectively simulate the behavior of random processes."
