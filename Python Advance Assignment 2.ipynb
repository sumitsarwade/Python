    "You should consider allowing operator overloading in your classes when it enhances the usability and clarity of your code. Here are some scenarios where operator overloading can be beneficial:\n",

    "Enhanced readability: If using a specific operator on instances of your class makes the code more readable and intuitive, it can be helpful to overload that operator. For example, if your class represents a mathematical vector, overloading the + operator to perform vector addition allows you to write vector1 + vector2 instead of vector1.add(vector2).\n",

    "Consistency with built-in types: If your class represents a concept similar to built-in types (such as numbers or sequences), overloading operators can make your class behave more like the built-in types.

For example, if your class represents a custom numeric type, overloading arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) can make your class work seamlessly with numeric operations.\n",

    "Domain-specific operations: If your class represents a domain-specific concept or data structure, operator overloading can enable you to define domain-specific operations on your objects.
