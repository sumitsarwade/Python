Text files store data in a human-readable format using characters from a character encoding system, such as ASCII or Unicode.

    "On the other hand, binary files store data in a binary format, representing information as sequences of 0s and 1s. They can contain any type of data, including text, images, audio, video, and executable code. Binary files are not human-readable as they don't follow a specific character encoding. They are typically used to store complex data structures and are processed by specific programs designed to interpret their binary format.\n",

One of the main concerns is platform compatibility due to differences in byte order (endianness) between systems. If the binary representation of an integer is written on one system and read on another with a different endianness, it can lead to incorrect values or data corruption. Additionally, directly writing integers as binary data may require manual conversion and handling of byte sequences, which can be error-prone and less portable across different programming languages and systems."

When using with, you don't need to explicitly call the close() method on the file object, as it is automatically done for you. This helps prevent resource leaks and improves code readability by clearly indicating the scope of the file operations. Additionally, the with statement provides built-in exception handling, ensuring that the file is closed even if an exception occurs during file operations."
