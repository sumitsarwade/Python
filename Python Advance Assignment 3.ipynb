    "In object-oriented programming, an abstract superclass is a class that serves as a blueprint for other classes, but cannot be instantiated itself. It is designed to be inherited by other classes, which are referred to as subclasses or derived classes. The abstract superclass provides a common set of attributes, methods, and behaviors that can be shared by multiple subclasses.\n",

An abstract method is a method that is declared in the abstract superclass but does not have an implementation. Instead, the responsibility of providing the implementation lies with the subclasses. Each subclass that extends the abstract superclass must provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods declared in the superclass. This enforces a contract between the superclass and its subclasses, ensuring that certain methods will always be implemented by any class derived from the abstract superclass."
