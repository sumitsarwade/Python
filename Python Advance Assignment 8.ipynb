This makes it difficult to distinguish between different exceptional situations and handle them appropriately.\n",

    "Limited Functionality: String-based exceptions lack the additional features and functionality provided by class-based exceptions. Class-based exceptions allow you to define custom attributes, methods, and hierarchies, making exception handling more flexible and powerful. With string-based exceptions, it is challenging to attach additional context information, perform specific exception handling based on exception types, or create custom exception hierarchies.\n",
